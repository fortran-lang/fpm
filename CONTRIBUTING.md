# Contributing to the Fortran Package Manager

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Fortran Package Manager (fpm).
Please take a moment to review this guidelines to make the contribution process simple and effective for all involved.

Respecting these guidelines helps communicate that you respect the time of the developers who manage and develop this open source project.
In return, they should return this respect by addressing your problem, evaluating changes, and helping you handle your pull requests.

We encourage and enforce high quality code.
Generally, follow the
[style guide of the Fortran stdlib](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/blob/master/STYLE_GUIDE.md)
for any contributed Fortran code.
This allows code review discussions to focus on semantics and substance rather than pedantry.


## Reporting a Bug

A bug is a _demonstratable problem_ caused by the code in this repository.
Good bug reports are extremely valuable for us - thank you!

Before opening a bug report:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if it still is an issue or has already been fixed?
   Try to reproduce it with the latest version from the default branch.
3. Isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
So please try to be as detailed as possible in your report, answer at least these questions:

1. Which version of fpm are you using?
   The current version is always a subject to change, so be more specific.
2. What steps will reproduce the issue?
   We have to reproduce the issue, so we need all the input files.
3. What would be the expected outcome?
4. What did you see instead?

All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.


## Suggesting a New Feature

Feature requests are welcome.
But take a moment to find out if your idea fits the scope and goals of the project.
It is up to you to provide a strong argument to convince the project's developers of the benefits of this feature.
Please provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Implementing a New Feature

Contributions are welcome via GitHub pull requests.
But suggest a new feature in an issue first to discuss the scope of the necessary changes or the required functionality before submitting a pull request.
You can always choose from one of the
[existing issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues).

- Each pull request should implement _one_ feature or fix _one_ bug.
  If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
- Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (_e.g._ `.gitignore`).
- Add tests for your new features or fixed bugs such that we can ensure that they stay functional and useful
- Be willing to accept criticism and work on improving your code.
  Have one to three maintainers review your contribution.
- Generally, follow the [style guide of the Fortran stdlib](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/blob/master/STYLE_GUIDE.md) for any contributed Fortran code.


### For New Contributors

If you never created a pull request before, welcome :tada:.
You can learn how from
[this great tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Don't know where to start?
You can start by looking through these
[help-wanted issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).


## Sign Your Work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for a commit.
All  commits needs to be signed.
Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to contribute the material.
The rules are pretty simple, if you can certify the below
