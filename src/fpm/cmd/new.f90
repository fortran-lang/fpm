module fpm_cmd_new
!># Definition of the "new" subcommand
!>
!> A type of the general command base class [[fpm_cmd_settings]]
!> was created for the "new" subcommand ==> type [[fpm_new_settings]].
!> This procedure read the values that were set on the command line
!> from this type to decide what actions to take.
!>
!> It is virtually self-contained and so independant of the rest of the
!> application that it could function as a separate program.
!>
!> The "new" subcommand options currently consist of a SINGLE top
!> directory name to create that must have a name that is an
!> allowable Fortran variable name. That should have been ensured
!> by the command line processing before this procedure is called.
!> So basically this routine has already had the options vetted and
!> just needs to conditionally create a few files.
!>
!> As described in the documentation it will selectively
!> create the subdirectories app/, test/, src/, and example/
!> and populate them with sample files.
!>
!> It also needs to create an initial manifest file "fpm.toml".
!>
!> It then calls the system command "git init".
!>
!> It should test for file existence and not overwrite existing
!> files and inform the user if there were conflicts.
!>
!> Any changes should be reflected in the documentation in
!> [[fpm_command_line.f90]]
!>
!> FUTURE
!> A filename like "." would need system commands or a standard routine
!> like realpath(3c) to process properly.
!>
!> Perhaps allow more than one name on a single command. It is an arbitrary
!> restriction based on a concensus preference, not a required limitation.
!>
!> Initially the name of the directory is used as the module name in the
!> src file so it must be an allowable Fortran variable name. If there are
!> complaints about it it might be changed. Handling unicode at this point
!> might be problematic as not all current compilers handle it. Other
!> utilities like content trackers (ie. git) or repositories like github
!> might also have issues with alternative names or names with spaces, etc.
!> So for the time being it seems prudent to encourage simple ASCII top directory
!> names (similiar to the primary programming language Fortran itself).
!>
!> Should be able to create or pull more complicated initial examples
!> based on various templates. It should place or mention other relevant
!> documents such as a description of the manifest file format in user hands;
!> or how to access registered packages and local packages,
!> although some other command might provide that (and the help command should
!> be the first go-to for a CLI utility).
