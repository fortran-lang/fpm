# Fortran Package Manager

Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a package manager and build system for Fortran.
Its key goal is to improve the user experience of Fortran programmers.
It does so by making it easier to build your Fortran program or library, run the
executables, tests, and examples, and distribute it as a dependency to other
Fortran projects.
Fpm's user interface is modeled after [Rust's Cargo](https://crates.io/),
so if you're familiar with that tool, you will feel at home with fpm.
Fpm's long term vision is to nurture and grow the ecosystem of modern Fortran
applications and libraries.

Fpm is an early prototype and is evolving rapidly.
You can use it to build and package your Fortran projects, as well as to use
existing fpm packages as dependencies.
Fpm's behavior and user interface may change as it evolves, however as fpm
matures and we enter production, we will aim to stay backwards compatible.
Please follow the [issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) to
contribute and/or stay up to date with the development.
Before opening a bug report or a feature suggestion, please read our
[Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Fortran Package Manager is not to be confused with
[Jordan Sissel's fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm), a more general,
non-Fortran related package manager.

## Getting started

### Setting up fpm

#### Binary download
`x86-64` binaries are available [to download](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/releases) for Windows, MacOS and Linux.

__Note:__ On Linux and MacOS, you will need to enable executable permission before you can use the binary.

_e.g._ `$ chmod u+x fpm-v0.1.0-linux-x86_64`

#### Conda

Fpm is available on conda-forge, to add conda-forge to your channels use:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Fpm can be installed with:

```
conda create -n fpm fpm
conda activate fpm
```

The conda package manager can be installed from [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases)
or from [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

#### Github Actions

To setup *fpm* within Github actions for automated testing, you can use the [fortran-lang/setup-fpm](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-fpm) action.

#### Bootstraping on other platforms

For other platforms and architectures have a look at the [bootstrapping instructions](#bootstrapping-instructions).

### Creating a new project

Creating a new *fpm* project is as simple as running the command
`fpm new project_name`. This will create a new folder in your current directory
with the following contents and initialized as a git repository.

* `fpm.toml` – with your project’s name and some default standard meta-data
* `README.md` – with your project’s name
* `.gitignore`
* `src/project_name.f90` – with a simple hello world subroutine
* `app/main.f90` (if `--with-executable` flag used) – a program that calls the subroutine
* `test/main.f90` (if `--with-test` flag used) – an empty test program

### Building your Fortran project with fpm

*fpm* understands the basic commands:

* `fpm build` – build your library, executables and tests
* `fpm run` – run executables
* `fpm test` – run tests

The command `fpm run` can optionally accept the name of the specific executable
to run, as can `fpm test`; like `fpm run specific_executable`. Command line
arguments can also be passed to the executable(s) or test(s) with the option
`-- some arguments`.

See additional instructions in the [Packaging guide](PACKAGING.md) or
the [manifest reference](manifest-reference.md).


### Bootstrapping instructions

This guide explains the process of building *fpm* on a platform for the first time.
If your platform and architecture are already supported, download the binary from the [release page](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/releases) instead.

#### Download this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm
$ cd fpm/
```

#### Build a bootstrap version of fpm

You can use the install script to bootstrap and install *fpm*:

```bash
$ ./install.sh
```

By default, the above command installs `fpm` to `${HOME}/.local/bin/`.
To specify an alternative destination use the `--prefix=` flag, for example:

```bash
$ ./install.sh --prefix=/usr/local
```

which will install *fpm* to `/usr/local/bin`.

To test that everything is working as expected you can now build *fpm*
with itself and run the tests with:

```bash
$ cd fpm
$ fpm test
```
